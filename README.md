# wordFrequencyAnalyzer
This short python script analyzes the frequency of strings in a text file. 
The separator is space, so a string might not be the same as a word.  
At the end the top x strings are plotted to a horizontal bar chart where x is a value chosen by the user.

Disclaimer:
There's very little formatting done to the chart as the script was spun up relatively quickly, so choosing more values is going to make the word-labels more and more stacked until they can no longer be read.
